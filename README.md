# 👋 Hey, I'm Hassanat Hussain

I'm a DevOps engineer who learns by building, breaking, and fixing real-world systems.  
Currently deep into the cloud, infrastructure-as-code, and automating everything that moves.

---

## 👀 What I'm into

- Building secure, scalable infrastructure using AWS, Terraform, and Ansible
- Making CI/CD pipelines cleaner and faster
- Monitoring systems like a paranoid SRE (Grafana/Prometheus/CloudTrail)
- Learning in public and documenting the messy, real parts
- Helping others who are just getting into DevOps figure it out faster than I did

---

## 🌱 What I'm working on

- Refreshing my portfolio and pushing projects to GitHub
- Writing a blog post on Terraform + IAM + CloudTrail mistakes
- Practicing Dragon Flags (because why not train core and code together?)
